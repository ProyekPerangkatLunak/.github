## Theme ✈️

Application, Android-Based

## Project Description 📕

We help our clients who are companies that are developing in the digitalization process, and in this project, we created an employee attendance system.

This system has several advantages, including:
* Track employees' attendance using a smartphone for Stakeholders or HR
* Image-based attendance (employees will take a  selfie for check-in and check-out)
* Easier control for Stakeholders to recap employee attendance for each day.
